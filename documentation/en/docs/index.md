### Commands

List of available commands to control the bot.

#### Chat commands

`/chat chat_name` - allows you to create a new chat or switch to an existing one.

`/chat` - allows you to return to normal chat. Also displays a list of created chats.

`/close_chat` - closes the chat room. You get to the default chat room.

`/clear_context` - clears the chat context. In fact, it deletes the chat and creates a new one. The behavior is maintained, as opposed to closing the chat room.

`/prompt your_question` - Allows you to ask a question outside the context of the main conversation.

`/current_chat` - returns the name of the current chat.

#### Behavior commands

In fact, the first message at the beginning of the chat, which tells how the AI should react. It is saved when the context is cleared, but is not saved when the chat is closed.

!!! note ""

    These commands work within the current chat, and do not affect other chats.

`/behavior behavior_description` - sets the bot's behavior for the current chat. 

`/current_behavior` - get the current behavior setting for the current chat.

`/clear_behavior` - removes the behavior settings for the current chat.

#### Other commands

`/balance` - Allows you to see the amount of money spent this month. Works only when you specify bot admins.

### Inline Mode

Inline mode allows you to use the bot in group chat, private chat, or in comments. Here's how it works:

<video controls width="300">
      <source id="mp4" src="inline.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

But for this mode to work it needs to be set up:

<video controls width="450">
      <source id="mp4" src="inline-setting.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

!!! warning "setinlinefeedback"

    Be sure to activate `/setinlinefeedback`, otherwise nothing will work.

## :heart:{ .heart } Support Develop

Sponsorship makes a project sustainable because it pays for the time of the maintainers of that project, a very scarce resource that is spent on developing new features, fixing bugs, improving stability, solving problems, and general support. The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.

## FAQ

??? question "What model is used?"

    For now the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is used. In future versions you will be able to choose the model.

??? question "What happens if my reply is longer than the allowed number of characters in one Telegram message?"

    That's okay, the answer will be broken up into several posts.
